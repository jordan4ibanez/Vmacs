# Vmacs
 My attempt to turn Emacs into VSCode
```
 __     __                                
 \ \   / / _ __ ___     __ _    ___   ___ 
  \ \ / / | '_ ` _ \   / _` |  / __| / __|
   \ V /  | | | | | | | (_| | | (__  \__ \
    \_/   |_| |_| |_|  \__,_|  \___| |___/
```

This was bootstrapped in vscode. (It was a nightmare)

This is built off, translated from: https://github.com/MAlba124/luamacs

For Ubuntu distros:

```
sudo apt install 
```

If running vim mode in emacs is considered evil. This is downright apocalyptic.
