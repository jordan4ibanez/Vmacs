Targeted Emacs version: 27.1 (Ubuntu Repo Target)

Fun fact: This was bootstrapped with VSCode. :D

First there was emacs, then there was evil mode, crazy mode after that.

I present to you: Lazy mode.

This version of Emacs is tailored as much as I can to behave like VSCode and Common Lisp development.

Here is a video on it: https://youtu.be/Q3ez5Aw_7nY

### How to install:
It is expected that you have SBCL installed and in your system path.

If you're unsure of this, try running ``sbcl`` in your terminal/command prompt.

Make sure you have no ``.emacs.d`` folder! If you do, back it up.

For first time startup, run this: (it's so treemacs doesn't open your home folder as a project on first startup)

```
git clone https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/Vmacs.git ~/.emacs.d/

cd ~/.emacs.d/

emacs
```

Or if you'd like to watch a video on how to install: https://youtu.be/88xj_45Dpzg

Vmacs will start to automatically install. Might take a minute.

Once it gets to the dashboard, let all the warnings with SLIME finish (wrongly documented/deprecated functions etc) and then close and open back up emacs.

After this, you can startup emacs like normal.

A small note: The first time you start it up it's going to take a minute to install all the packages.

If you don't want to ever check for updates, or maybe only once in a while, there is ``turn-on-automatic-package-updates``. I recommend once in a while because it slows down startup a lot.
It's enabled by default, though.

Side note: You have to click the REPL before it will start outputting debug info unfortunately.

### TODO:

figure out how to split vertically proportioned like vscode

figure out if there's a way to disable region getting removed on shift+tab

### Notes:

- You can run the terminal with ``ansi-term`` perhaps this can be linked to ``ctrl-~``

- Document the key bindings. They're in the code, put them somewhere legible.

### Ican'tThinkOfAGoodName's ideas:

- You shouldn't kill the *Messages* buffer. It will contain useful debugging information. Besides, whenever some code sends a message, the buffer will get created again.
>^ Going to test this.

- You can make this go in a different file by modifying the custom-file variable.
>^ Going to look into this

### mrkubax10's ideas:
- Also maybe it would be possible to remove some unnecessary Emacs bloat like ERC, gnus etc. also games
>^
- Anything that you don't use probably. Major modes for languages for example. No idea if it's possible to remove that
>^
- Also as I said these "programs" inside Emacs like ERC, gnus, rmail, Tetris, Snake, Adventure etc
>^ I would also like this
